    <h3>An easy to make, healthy lettuce wrap!</h3>
    <p>Delicious and bursting with flavor, Asian lettuce wraps are a great idea for entertaining or a family style meal. Each person can build their own fresh, delicious wrap. Just be sure to have plates or napkins available since the mixture can sometimes drip a little. To serve, allow each person to spoon a portion of the meat into a lettuce leaf. Wrap the lettuce around the meat like a burrito and enjoy! </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>16 butter lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>

        <li>1 can water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Asian (dark) seasame oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl.</li>

        <li>Spread 1 cup cooked tomato and vegetable sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Lay down 1/2 of the lasagna noodles and layer 1/2 each of the ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese on top. Repeat layering again with noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
